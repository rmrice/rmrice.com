        <p>One of my friends from my gym completed a million meter row challenge, where over the course of 2015 he rowed 1,000,000 meters on a Concept-2 rower. It was a huge accomplishment for him so I made him this map to show where he could have rowed to over the course of the year. The map shows four scenarios that would cover 1,000,000 meters. I chose the Great Lakes because he's from Michigan. </p>

        <p>This was my last cartographic project at GMU, which I created for GMU's annual map competition at GIS Day (November 2015). The assignment was to create a map/infographic illustrating how Tysons, VA is changing to become a more accessible, liveable city. I created this mainly in Adobe Illustrator, but imported the map data from ArcGIS. This project invovled a lot of generalization and simplification in order to create a clean and attractive final product (and I won the map competition). </p>

This map was a challenge because it is very skewed (much like DC's metro map) and not to scale. The data was obtained from GMU's GIS repository and imported to ArcMap, and then exported to Adobe Illustrator, where I completed all of the map design. </p>

        <p>I created this cartogram as part of my final project for a thematic cartography class I took Spring 2015. I decided to make a cartogram because I've never made one before and I like a challenge ;) The cartogram demonstrates the food deficit in Africa by country, with the larger circles indicating a greater food deficit. Food deficit is defined as the amount of calories needed to lift the undernourished from their current status, as calculated by the US Food and Agriculture Administration. Circles outlined in red/green indicate whether or not the food defecit situation has improved in the past 25 years (with red being an increase in food defecit and a green being a decrease in food defecit). This was created solely with Adobe Illustrator after exporting basemap data from ArcGIS to create the choropleth map (below).</p>

        <p>This was part two of my final project for my thematic cartography class (GGS 551).

I obtained the base data from diva-gis.org and the food deficit data from the US Food and Agriculture Administration. I first imported the data into ArcMap and then exported it into an .ai file and did all of the design in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

This was the best result I came up with, with 3 districts representing democrats and 2 representing republicans to reflect the 60/40 democrat-republican split in 2008, in addition to following zoning size requirements set forth by the Supreme Court.

        <p>This map illustrates the number of disasters by state in the US along with population density. The number of disasters in each state is demonstrated by proportional symbols, while population density (pop. per sq.mile) is distrbuted in quantiles (5 classes). The most challenging aspect of creating this map was labeling, and making sure labels (and the symbols!) were legible in the northeast corridor.

        <p>I made a series of figures for a publication portraying how different accessibility needs (those who are in wheelchairs, vision-impaired, etc.) affect routing. The first box shows a desired route, though it contains both stairs/steep paths and an obstacle reported to our system. Users who are wheelchair-bound must avoid stairs and steep paths that are not ADA compliant, resulting in the second path (in the middle). If the user chooses to avoid reported obstacles, then their route becomes even longer.<br><br>

        <p>This is the theoretical example of how using image geotags should work to validate the position of volunteered information. The user takes multiple pictures of an obstacle, and uploads those images to our database, attached to a report that includes a location that the user chose by positioning a locator icon on the map(hand-based georeferencing), as well as a text description of the location and obstacle details. If the device the contributor used contains a GPS, we can extract (1) a point location (lat-long coordinates), and (2) a compass direction that indicates which direction the camera was facing when taking the picture. From these two pieces of information, we can create a series of points and trajectories that should point to the subject (which in this case, is the obstacle). We can then compare this location to the user-contributed location in order to validate position.</p>

        <p>We tested a series of devices, including a Cannon DSLR, a Nikon CoolPix point-and-shoot camera, and an iPhone 6+ on an LTE network, with varying results. While we got good results for the Cannon DSLR and Nikon CoolPix, the iPhone 6+ had the most unreliable result, with the trajectories pointing in the opposite direction in almost every case. Unfortunately, most of our contributors will be using an iPhone or other smart phone when submitting reports. Mobile device GPS accuracy tends to be better when on WiFi, which we still haven't tested. However, this serves as an example of how image geotags can be used to locate the subject of the image, and how well different devices work to do achieve this.  </p>

     <p> I acknowledge that the scale bar units are different in some of these examples. Publishing internationally, we use the metric system (which is also my preferred measurement system because, you know, it's scientific) while our research sponsors might prefer us to use US customary measurements.</p>

<p>The data that we obtain from our geocrowdsourcing testbed is being used for an obstacle-avoidance routing application. The goal of the obstacle-avoidance application is to route the end-user around osbtacles, based on their mobility needs. The routing application also functions as a mechanism to warn the user they are about to approach the obstacle, if the user does not specify to be routed around certain obstacles. We have currently tested the interaction buffers for a variety of mobile devices that our end-users may be using in the field, including an iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6+, and iPad 2, in both walking and bicycling scenarios. I created some figures explaining our results for our technical report.</p>
<p>This shows the interaction buffers for each device in scenarios in which the user is either walking (left) or bicycling (right). The interaction buffer is when the device being used detects an obstacle in our system as the user is either walking or riding (bicycling) towards it. </p>

It was modified from a class project I did for a class on Natural Hazards and Disasters, which I took Spring 2013. I won the award for "Best Overall Poster and Presentation" in the undergraduate category. This project was interesting because it was before VGI and crowdsourcing became popular in humanitarian relief efforts, and helped spark my interest in VGI applications.</p>
