      I took out a lot of my old GIS asignments, charts and diagrams, and research posters because I felt they were cluttering up the page. If you're interested in looking at them you can find everything <a href="/portfolio_archive.html">here</a>. On my list to do is reformat this page to clean it up and also add some of my more recent web maps and stylesheets :)

        <p>One of my friends from my gym completed a million meter row challenge, where over the course of 2015 he rowed 1,000,000 meters on a Concept-2 rower. It was a huge accomplishment for him so I made him this map to show where he could have rowed to over the course of the year. The map shows four scenarios that would cover 1,000,000 meters. I chose the Great Lakes because he's from Michigan. </p>

        <p>This was my last cartographic project at GMU, which I created for GMU's annual map competition at GIS Day (November 2015). The assignment was to create a map/infographic illustrating how Tysons, VA is changing to become a more accessible, liveable city. I created this mainly in Adobe Illustrator, but imported the map data from ArcGIS. This project invovled a lot of generalization and simplification in order to create a clean and attractive final product (and I won the map competition). </p>

        <p>This is a shuttle route map I created for George Mason University's GIS Day competition (November 2014). I won the award for best graduate map! This map was a challenge because it is very skewed (much like DC's metro map) and not to scale. The data was obtained from GMU's GIS repository and imported to ArcMap, and then exported to Adobe Illustrator, where I completed all of the map design. </p>

        <p>This was an assignment for my thematic cartography class but I really like how it turned out. The assignment was simple to make a road map of Fairfax County and make sure to locate George Mason University's Fairfax campus. Data imported to ArcMap and then exported to Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>I created this cartogram as part of my final project for a thematic cartography class I took Spring 2015. I decided to make a cartogram because I've never made one before and I like a challenge ;) The cartogram demonstrates the food deficit in Africa by country, with the larger circles indicating a greater food deficit. Food deficit is defined as the amount of calories needed to lift the undernourished from their current status, as calculated by the US Food and Agriculture Administration. Circles outlined in red/green indicate whether or not the food defecit situation has improved in the past 25 years (with red being an increase in food defecit and a green being a decrease in food defecit). This was created solely with Adobe Illustrator after exporting basemap data from ArcGIS to create the choropleth map (below).</p>
