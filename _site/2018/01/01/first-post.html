<p>(Am I Right?) I’m blogging. I have been wanting to get into writing more. I’ve recognized that I am a bit out of touch with my feelings, which appropriates the need for me to keep a journal. This is not a journal. Eventually I hope to blog about tech-y things, traveling, and my unique life experiences, but since I have a lot on my mind, this first post will get a little personal.</p>

<h3 id="reflecting-on-2017">reflecting on 2017</h3>

<p>I learned a lot about myself in 2017. I’ve come to the realization that I am truly an introvert and socializing can be exhausting, but at the same time I love engaging with other people because people are so weird and interesting. I paid off my student loans and moved out. I recovered from a back &amp; hip injury. I learned more about how my body works and which parts overcompensate for my weaknesses. I got stronger. I traveled to 4 new countries and 1 new state. I became more independent. I felt more empowered as a woman. I made some big jumps in my career. I’m more empathetic. I know more about what I want to gain from relationships. I learned more about nutrition.</p>

<p>There are also some not so positive things. I lost touch with a lot of friends. I became more apathetic towards some things that are happening in the world. I am not always upfront. I can be very unpleasant when I’m annoyed. I’m less empathetic. I spent a lot of my money on self-care, travel, and food (which is not necessarily bad… but one month I spent almost $600 on groceries for just me– a little excessive). I don’t put any effort into dating. I spend too much time on my phone. I don’t always sleep well (though this is getting better).</p>

<p>Everything’s ok. That’s life. With all the good things come some bad, and all the bad come with a learning experience. This is how we grow as humans.</p>

<h3 id="2018-goals">2018 goals</h3>
<p>I am behind the philosophy that the first day of the new year is a new day, but so are the other 364 days of the year, and you don’t necessarily need the year to change in order for you to better yourself. That said, I would describe myself as goal-oriented. These are some things I hope to achieve in 2018, though they don’t all necessarily have a timeline.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Front squat &gt; 200# ( I have a list of all my fitness goals on my phone… I’m not going to list all of them here but I’ll let this one be representative since this would be huge for me )</li>
  <li>Compete in an oly meet</li>
  <li>Write more</li>
  <li>Read more</li>
  <li>Code more</li>
  <li>Save more money</li>
  <li>Clean out my closet, for real for real, and donate what I no longer use</li>
  <li>Read before bed rather than play on my phone</li>
  <li>Be friendlier; talk to more strangers</li>
  <li>Make my bed</li>
</ul>
