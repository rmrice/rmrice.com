<p>Rebecca (she/her) is a software engineer with a background in cartography.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at <a href="mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>, specializing in enabling Mapbox to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/atlas/">run offline</a>. In the short time I’ve worked at Mapbox, combined with my previous knowledge of Mapbox tools, I’ve become somewhat of an expert on the Mapbox stack– what goes into our data pipeline, to how map tiles are rendered and our our APIs work. I have dipped my feet in a variety of projects, including work on our Maps APIs, fronted internal tools, and our on-premises solution.</p>

<p>I am a skilled node.js developer, with a passion for optimizing Docker builds, efficient scaling, and beautifully architected code. As a cartographer, I believe that attention to detail is important, but I also abide by the motto “move fast and break things.” I enjoy frontend development equally as I enjoy backend development, but in different ways. I thrive on attempting to solve complex problems, and sometimes succeeding.</p>

<p>Formerly, I worked at <a href="radiantsolutions.com">Radiant Solutions</a> with my work revolving around the OpenStreetMap stack and use-cases for the government. My claim to fame (beyond being a fullstack Cartographer) was designing the <a href="https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny">Hootenanny</a> logo.</p>

<p>My background is extensively geo-based, with a BA in geography and GIS and a MS in geographic and cartographic science from George Mason University. At GMU, my research was focused on the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI). My <a href="http://ebot.gmu.edu/handle/1920/10522">master’s thesis</a> examined the quality of GMU’s own geocrowdsourcing testbed, an application that utilized crowdsourcing to gain critical information on pedestrian obstacles around campus.</p>

<p>My hobbies include crossfit, olympic weightlifting, travel, and anything involving food.</p>
