# about me

Rebecca is a software developer with a background in cartography, currently employed at [Radiant Solutions](http://www.radiantsolutions.com/) (formerly DigitalGlobe Analytic Solutions) as a geospatial-analyst-turned-software-engineer and aspiring full-stack cartographer.

Right now, most of my work revolves around the OpenStreetMap stack and use-cases for the government.

I have an extensive background in geospatial, with a BA in geography and GIS and a MS in geographic and cartographic science from George Mason University. There, I completed research on the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and wrote my master's thesis on the quality of GMU's own geocrowdsourcing testbed, an application that utilized crowdsourcing to gain critical information on pedestrian obstacles around campus.

My hobbies include crossfit, travel, and anything involving food.
