# about me

Rebecca is a software developer with a background in cartography, now working as a Maps API Engineer at [Mapbox](mapbox.com).

Formerly, she worked at [Radiant Solutions](radiantsolutions.com) with her work revolving around the OpenStreetMap stack and use-cases for the government.

I have an extensive background in geospatial, with a BA in geography and GIS and a MS in geographic and cartographic science from George Mason University. There, I completed research on the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and wrote my master's thesis on the quality of GMU's own geocrowdsourcing testbed, an application that utilized crowdsourcing to gain critical information on pedestrian obstacles around campus.

My hobbies include crossfit, travel, and anything involving food.
